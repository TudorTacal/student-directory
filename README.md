# student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

It contains a menu with options that you can select from. It takes as input a student's name and cohort. It a cohort isn't provided it adds one by default. Then it gives the option to save the list to a file on the local machine and also upload a list from the local machine. The list uses CSV format. 

This command line app was part of a weekly challenge at Maker's Academy. The final version of the script prints it's source code to the screen.
